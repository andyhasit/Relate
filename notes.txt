Should ChildrenOfParentCollection be passed it's ParentOfChildCollection?
So that it can find which indexEntry has a child.
  - so it can do the unlinking from existing parent itself in .link()
  - so it can do the unlinking when told to .forget() // which will to a type check on the item that it is asked to forget.
  
That way, collections can be told of relationships they need to call forget() on when an item is deleted.

projects.registerRelationship()

So when it deletes an item, it goes via the relationship object, which deletes all the child items and removes references from lnk collections.


So if a task exists in a project, and in a schedule, we tell the task collection about those relationships.
When a project is deleted, it informs the task-project relationship, which:
    recognising it as the parent in the relationship, calls task collection.delete() on each task, which
        informs the task-project relationship, which:
            recognising it as the child, unlinks itself by deleting records in both collections.
            
            
            
            (no child
    unlinks the tasks from their project 
    
    
    deletes all the tasks, which each:
        informs the relat

maybe have a flag to indicate if in a cascade delete operation, in which case, child items don't bother deleting themselves from childrenOfParent collection
as that entry will be deleted anyway (and it would create lots of db operations.


Next steps:
    tests for Collection with db mock.
    test ParentOfChildCollection functions
    
later:

    get delete registering
    Can certain collections be lazy loaded? Like notes? In that case may we need a one-to-one relationship? And if this is the case we'd load by query, not allDocs.
